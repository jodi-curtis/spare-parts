Title: Spare Parts Ordering Application
Description: For my Final assignment I have created a Spare Parts Ordering application using Django. The application has 2 types of users â€“ Engineers and Store Managers. The application allows engineers to search for and order spare parts required to fix their machines. Store managers will be able to view all orders placed by the engineers on their order dashboard and they can update the status of the order to alert engineers when their order is ready for collection. The application allows the Store Managers to create, update and delete parts as well as receipt stock in. They can view which parts have reached below their low stock warning and should be reordered. Store managers can also set announcements which will be visible on the engineers home page.
This application solves a real issue in my current workplace and has been populated with a sample of data from parts in our stores.
